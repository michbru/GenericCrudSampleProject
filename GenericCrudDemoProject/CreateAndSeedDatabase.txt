Of the three, Tanmay becomes her best friend, Akshat remains out of bounds, because he is her sister’s ex-boyfriend, and Karthik remains a mystery, for whom Niharika has conflicted feelings. But later, Niharika discovers that his aggressiveness is simply a blanket to hide his past. She also goes on to make friends with Pia, who is also her roommate. Things start to spice up when Tanmay develops an interest for Pia. Pia begins reciprocating the same, but she is also involved in a long distance relationship with another boy named Vishal.

She juggles school work and fun, amidst schoolgirl crushes on boys including Ankit, and gossip and girl talk with her best friend. However, one day, an innocent crush explodes into a chain of irreversible events that result in changing her life forever. 18 years later, Diksha, the feisty, fun loving teenager, has been replaced by a very different version of her younger self. Now, at the age of 35, she is a jaded and bored housewife beneath the facade of a happily married woman. Married at 19 to Sandeep, a successful professional, and mother to a bright young boy, she is an unhappy woman who is dissatisfied in her loveless marriage and trapped in a domestic setting she no longer feels connected to. When an unfortunate incident involving her cousin’s husband takes place, it brings all her unmet hopes and desires to the fore, opening up possibilities Diksha never felt she would find again. Stemming from a desire to fulfill her hopes and dreams, a secret wish list is born. It urges Diksha to following her heart and explore the possibilities of unrequited love that she denied herself for so many years. The Secret Wish List is a sensitive account of a woman’s soul searching and attempts at self discovery in order to find true happiness. Its intriguing storyline tackles the moral dilemma and temptations of an extramarital affair, the elusive nature of true love and whether it really does exist, the fragility of friendship and relationships, and the significance of one’s dreams.')

Through the book, the author aims to expose the mastermind behind the explosion of the third bullet that killed the President. In the beginning of the book, an author, who is investigating the assassination is run down by a car. His wife, convinced that it was not an accident but a murder, approaches Bob Lee Swagger for help in the investigation. He sets out to explore several unanswered questions relating to the assassination. The points that puzzle him are the explosion of the third bullet and why Lee Oswald headed back to his place to retrieve the pistol instead of carrying it with him. Swagger also tries to understand how the assassination was planned before the route that the ex-President was going to take was announced. The Third Bullet takes an interesting turn when CIA operative, Hugh Meachum, comes into the scene with secrets that nobody knows of. But, he is unwilling to reveal them for various reasons.

His daughter, Scout is the narrator of the story and she lives with her widowed father and brother. To Kill A Mockingbird first explores the customs of the South, laying down all the quirks and foibles of the neighbors and people that Scout interacts with through her childhood days. The story of how her brother Jem injured his arm at the elbow is what starts off Scott’s reminiscing journey. This leads them to point out that it was the Ewells who set off the entire string of events that brought about the unsavory incident. And this is what is at the heart of the novel. The narrative that is so delicately handled by Lee is insightful and intuitive. Atticus is appointed by the court to defend a black man, Tom Robinson who has been accused of raping a white girl, Mayella. However the town doesn’t need a trial since they are steeped in prejudice against the coloured people and to them, Robinson is guilty of the crime. However, Atticus defends Tom to the best of his ability that turns the residents of this otherwise sleepy town against him and his family members. For the most part, the townspeople engage in hurling insults at the middle-aged man, which is unacceptable to the sprightly Scout. She along with her brother and their friend, Dill manage to disperse the mob of people but the situation grows worse.  Will Tom Robinson serve time for a crime he did not commit and will Scout lose her love for the South as she had before? A poignantly simple tale of losing innocence and more to the law of society, To Kill a Mockingbird does more than just enlighten people.')
